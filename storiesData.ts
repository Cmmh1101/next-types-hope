      `One of our kids is Dylan. He arrived at “Casa Esperanza” when he was two years old. His mother left him behind for unknown reasons. His dad didn't know how to provide for him because he was too young, homeless, and unable to provide for him. Eventually, he left him with the promise to come back while he looks for a better opportunity in the border between Colombia and Venezuela. Unfortunately, he got sick with tuberculosis making him weak and unable to work.`,
